    "You’re a POC and a girl in your sorority who is obviously not, keeps dropping the word that shall not be said to a POC. She sings it in songs, uses it in conversations about the men she dates, it makes you uncomfortable.",
    "A classmate compliments your hair today and thinks your curls are just so beautiful that they begin touching and playing with your hair.",
    "Someone stops you in the middle of a conversation to ask what your ethnicity is.",
    "You see your friend dressed up in a sacred headdress for halloween, everyone thinks it looks so cool but it’s offensive to your culture."
